Scripts for Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and any other microcontroller I end up with.

Arduino IDE 1.0.3+ demands that each sketch resides in a directory with the same name as the sketch. Hence that directory structure is present here so that you can git clone, use the IDE, edit sketches and then git commit in the usual way.
